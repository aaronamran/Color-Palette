## JavaScript and jQuery Implementation

The JavaScript code, enhanced with jQuery, enables dynamic interactions with the color palette. The functions use jQuery to manipulate HTML and CSS elements, creating a responsive and user-friendly experience. Key functions include:

- `setSectionColor(section, color)`: Sets the background color of a given color section.

- `getRandomColor()`: Generates a random color code.

- `addColorSection()`: Adds a new color section to the palette, setting its color and adjusting its width to fill the available space.

- `adjustSectionWidths()`: Adjusts the widths of all color sections based on the total number of sections.
